Resource Agent for AWS EC2 ENI for Pacemaker

This resource agent script is intended for use with Amazon EC2 instances running Linux operating systems and Pacemaker.

The scripts have been tested on the following Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) version:

* CentOS 7

The scripts have been tested on the following Pacemaker version:

* Pacemaker 1.1.13-10.el7_2.4

## Prerequisites

This script requires [AWS Command Line Interface](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
Also you'll need the "jq" package from EPEL repo and "wget" from standart repos.

### Install AWS Command Line Interface

If pip is not installed, install pip with following commands:
```
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```
To install awscli, use pip:

```
pip install awscli
```

Don't forget to configure it!

## Getting Started

Download "eni" or clone repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/moomindani/aws-eni-resource-agent.git
cd aws-eni-resource-agent
```

Install eip resource agent:

```
mv eni /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/heartbeat/
chown root:root /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/heartbeat/eni
chmod 0755 /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/heartbeat/eni
```

After setting up pacemaker, configure crm setting to make eni resource agent ready.
Here's an example setting:

```

    no-quorum-policy="ignore" \
    stonith-enabled="false" \
    crmd-transition-delay="0s"

primitive eni ocf:heartbeat:eni \
    params \
        interface_id="eni-2a718a5d" \
        device_index="1" \
        device_name="eth1" \
        gateway="172.31.0.1" \
        wait="60" \
        table_id="100" \
        table_priority="100" \
    op start   timeout="120s" interval="0s"  on-fail="stop" \
    op monitor timeout="60s" interval="10s" on-fail="restart" \
